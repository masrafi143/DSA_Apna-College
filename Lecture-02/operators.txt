=   Assign value
+=  a += b => a = a + b
-=  a -= b => a = a - b
*=  a *= b => a = a * b
/=  a /= b => a = a / b
%=  a %= b => a = a % b

5. Unary Operators
++  Increment by 1
--  Decrement by 1

6. Bitwise Operators (low-level operations)
&   Bitwise AND

^   Bitwise XOR
~   Bitwise NOT
<<  Left Shift
>>  Right Shift

7. Other Useful Operators
